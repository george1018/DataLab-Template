######----------------- read and clean the data  -----------------######

# read the dataset
csv_url <- "https://shorturl.at/eixVX"
survey <- fread(csv_url)

# check the data
str(survey)
head(survey)
summary(survey)

# change names
survey %>%
    setnames("Timestamp", "timestamp") %>%
    str()

# change names from second column to the last column
survey %>%
    setnames(2:ncol(survey), paste0("q", 1:(ncol(survey) - 1))) %>%
    str()

# check NA values
sapply(survey, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) %>% kable()

# convert the data type of the first column to date and time
survey %>%
    .[, timestamp := as.POSIXct(timestamp, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")] %>%
    str()

# create a new column called year
survey %>%
    .[, year := format(timestamp, "%Y")] %>%
    str()


# advanced one
# select columns that start with "q" and the data
# type of the columns are character
# query column names first 
survey %>%
    .[, .SD, .SDcols = patterns("^q")] %>%
    .[, .SD, .SDcols = is.character] %>%
    names() -> select_col_names

       .SDcols = select_col_names] 

str(survey)

# save the data set
fwrite(survey, "survey_cleaned.csv")


######----------------- check duplicates and NAs -----------------######
# duplicates and NAs are tricky
# you need to check them carefully
# to check duplicates, you need to set up a criteria
# for instance q1 has two answers: yes and no
# many people might answer yes but this does not mean
# they are duplicates
str(survey)

# in our case, we can use the timestamp as the criteria
# to check duplicates

# check how many duplicates
survey %>%
    .[, .N, by = timestamp] %>%

    kable()

# check the duplicates
survey %>%
    .[timestamp == "2023-04-20 23:44:06"] %>%
    kable()

# another way to check duplicates (the best way)
survey %>%
    .[duplicated(timestamp) | duplicated(timestamp, fromLast = TRUE)] %>%
    kable()

# get unique values
survey %>%
    .[!duplicated(timestamp)] %>%
    str()

# or use unique function (the best way)
# when you use unique function, you need put by = "variable_name"
# as unique function is basic R function, whereas 
# duplicated function is data.table function
# which means you can pass variable name to duplicated function
# directly without putting quotation marks
survey %>%
    unique(by = "timestamp") %>%
    str()

# save the data set
survey %>%
    unique(by = "timestamp") %>%
